Tutorials
*********

Most of the tutorials presented here can should work 
for every user having a valid version of VACUMM.
However, some of them may not work directly because, for instance,
they need an access to a huge dataset; 
they are in the documentation for inspiration purpose only.

Another source of tutorials is the :ref:`testing suite<appendix.tests>`.
