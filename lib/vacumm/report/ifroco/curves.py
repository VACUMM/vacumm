        - **data**: Single 1D variable or a list of variables or tuples.
          Each tuple has its first item as a variable, and second item
          as plot line specification such as 'r-' for red solid line.

          .. warning:: All variables must have a proper long_name attribute
            that will be displayed in the legend if there are more
            than one variable.

        - **units**, optional: Change data units displayed in the left label.
        - **long_name**, optional: Name dispay in the left label.
        - **title**, optional: Title as a string or list of strings.
          It is dsipayed using :func:`~vacumm.report.common.add_title`.
        - **copyright**, optional: Add a copyright (multi-)line to the plot
          using :func:`~vacumm.report.common.add_copyright`.
        - **logos**, optional: Add logos to the plot
          using :func:`~vacumm.report.common.add_logos`.
        - **savefig**, optional: Save the figure to  this file.
