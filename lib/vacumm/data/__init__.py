        - **ncfile**: Netcdf file name(s) or pattern compatibile with

          please read the documentation of this function carefully.
        - **clsname**: Generic class name. Please choose one of:
          %s
        - All other keyword are passed to the class initialization.
          See :class:`~vacumm.data.misc.dataset.Dataset` a list of these options.
