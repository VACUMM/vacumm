Installations
=============


.. highlight:: bash


Quick installation with :program`conda`
---------------------------------------

Conda is a package manager that provides pre-compiled binaries
for Windows, OSX and Linux.

Install `conda <https://conda.io/docs/index.html>`_ first
from this `page <https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html>`_.
Miniconda is a mini installer it is good to start with.

Then, you can install vacumm and its dependecies::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge -c uvcdat -c vacumm -c acme vacumm

For more option, please read the conda documentation.

From sources
------------

In short
........

Here is an example of basic installation inside UV-CDAT, 
with some OpenMP parallelisation::

    $ cp setup.cfg.omp setup.cfg
    $ python setup.py install

For all users
.............

This installation puts the library within the python tree.
The :program:`python` excutable must be the one provided by UV-CDAT
(see :ref:`user.install.prereq`).

One compile and install VACUMM from the main directory of the package with::

    $ python setup.py install

For more options::

    $ python setup.py --help


For our own usage
.................

In this case, the library is installed in the user's directory.

First, compile::

    $ python setup.py build
    
Then, install in the default user's directory 
(typically  :file:`/home/<user>/.local/lib/python2.{x}/site-packages`)::

    $ python setup.py install --user

If the library must be installed in a special directory, use::

    $ python setup.py install --prefix=/my/special/dir

Then, set your environment variables to have acces both to the python library
and to the executables::

    $ export PATH=/my/special/dir/bin
    $ export PYTHONPATH=/my/special/dir/lib/python{x.x}/site-packages  # {x.x} refers to the python version


.. _user.install.install.dev:
    
Local installation for a developper
...................................

VACUMM must be used directly after an untar or a checkout by
compiling the extensions and setting the variables::

    $ make lib # or python setup.py build_ext --inplace
    $ export PATH=~/path/to/vacumm-trunk/bin
    $ export PYTHONPATH=~/path/to/vacumm-trunk/lib/python
    

You can also use the environment module provided
with the package as presented at section :ref:`user.install.modenv.dev`.


Tuning the installation
-----------------------

You can tune the installation with the :file:`setup.cfg` file, 
following the instruction of the official documentations 
(`here <https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/configfile.html#writing-the-setup-configuration-file>`_).
Two examples are provided, which differ in the way the fortran extension
is compilated:

- The :file:`setup.cfg.simple` simply specifies the compiler type:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../setup.cfg.simple
        :language: ini

- The :file:`setup.cfg.omp` makes the compilation to use OpenMP:

  .. literalinclude:: ../../../setup.cfg.omp
        :language: ini

For example, to quickly allow OpenMP parallelisation, 
link to the right setup configuration file before installing::

    $ cp setup.cfg.omp setup.cfg
    $ python setup.py build_ext --force # to force the recompilation
    
    
.. note:: If the :file:`setup.cfg` file doesn't exist, the :program:`setup.py`
    will copy file:`setup.cfg.simple` into :file:`setup.cfg`.

.. _user.install.install.config:
    
User configuration of the modules
---------------------------------

Some of the modules can be configured to change their default behaviour.
Configurations store for instance default paths.

The library is configured by default for a use on the supercomputer
from IFREMER (CAPARMOR).
If you are on your own system or you want to change your configuration,
please check the documentation section :ref:`user.install.config`.

During the installation process using the :program:`setup.py`,
you can provide a general configuration file and secondary configuration
files with :option:`--cfgfiles` option (comma separated).
All these files will be installed in the :file:`vacumm-config` directory.

For instance, the configuration of the :mod:`vacumm.bathy.bathy`
module makes a reference to a secondary configuration file
refered in the config section ``[vacumm.bathy.bathy]`` with the
key ``cfgfile_gridded``.
To alter this configuration, proceed in this way:
    
    #. Specify the name of the secondary config file in the main config file by prefixing it with ``%(conf_dir)s``, which is the directory where config files will be installed (see :ref:`user.install.config`):
        
       .. code-block:: ini
       
           [vacumm.bathy.bathy]
           cfgfile_gridded=%(conf_dir)s/bathy.gridded.cfg
           
    #. Then specify the list of config files as comandline option::
       
            $ python setup.py install --cfgfiles=myconfig.cfg,path/to/bathy.gridded.cfg
            
 
Check your installation
-----------------------

Run::

    $ vacumm_print_config.py
