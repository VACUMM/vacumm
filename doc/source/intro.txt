        *"Validation, Analysis, Comparison - Utilities written in Python to validate and analyze
        Multi-Model outputs, and compare them to observations."*
    
        -- Abstract translated from the 
        `forge page <https://forge.ifremer.fr/projects/vacumm>`_ of the project.

    
VACUMM provides generic and specialized tools for the validation ocean models, and more especially
the MARS model from IFREMER.
The heart of VACUMM is a :ref:`library <lib>` written mainly
in the `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ language, 
whose :ref:`core <lib.misc>` can be used for the *preprocessing* et le 
*postprocessing* of oceanic and atmospheric data coming from models or observations.
The library for instance also has specialized modules for managing outputs from 
:ref:`models <lib.data.model>` and making advanced
:ref:`diagnostics <lib.diag>`.
